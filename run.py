    Essentially, you want connected(start, a_1) ∧ connected(a_1,a_2) ∧ ... ∧ connected(a_n, end). Here the a_i's are grid spaces. 
    If this expression evaluates to True (for some n) then you have a solution. Once you set up all the constraints and propositions, 
    checking this won't be too hard. You just need to write some code that checks all possible values of n to see if there is a path.
